# kc-energy
College project written in Java and MySQL. Application that creates/connects to a MySQL database and allows end user to create, maintain, and delete accounts for customers of an energy company. For information on how to run this application, see the Word document alongside this one.

The requirements for this project was to create a front-end GUI that allowed an energy company to manage the personal information, energy meters, and charges of its customers by connecting to a SQL back-end. Each customer can have any number of meters attached to their account, which in turn can accrue any number of charges from energy usage. These charges can be marked as paid or unpaid. Upon any changes to the outstanding balance of a user's account (creating new charges, changing the status of a charge, or deleting a charge or meter), the database will automatically recalculate the balance and update itself. The user can navigate between different frames within the application using buttons and tables, which pull their information from the database. The application can also create a PDF detailing the meters and charges associated with any of the customers at the push of a button.
